    <h1>Lost and Found</h1>
    <p class="ppp"> When I received this description, I felt it was a deeply moving story, a reflection of Vasuki's childhood memories. I quickly connected it to my own similar experiences from when I was young. Vasuki mentioned that the bracelet was simple, without much decoration or complexity. So, I thought that drawing just the bracelet would make the image feel too plain and wouldn’t fully convey Vasuki's reflections on her mother and childhood. That’s why I decided to include her mother’s hand in the drawing as well. The drawing process wasn’t too difficult; it was a simple matter of stacking rectangles to form the shape of the hand. To differentiate the fingers, I adjusted the curves of each one. Instead of drawing many small golden rings, which would have been repetitive, I found a function that allowed me to replicate and place circles along an arc path. After copying and placing the golden circles, I added a row of small circles in a skin tone, which completed the gold bracelet design.</p>
